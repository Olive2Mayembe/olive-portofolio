<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<hr/>
<p>my name is olive mayembe mimbembe, i am currently a final year student in computer engineer at csu university. 
  I am a very fast learner and listenner. i love whatever that is related to beauty. i am sentimental, out-going, 
   indecisive,  understanding,  curious, naive,  lazy,  and young.  I want to be a professional network engineer
    ,well a lot of things, and growing is discovering what they are.
    I feel people cannot see the potential within, although there is no one to blame but myself. 
    I don’t like to socialize;  It makes me bored.</p>

<p>I am weak in some respects, but in others I am strong.My life is a balance of ups and downs sometimes. 
  With my extremes however,  my scales never fulfill the word "balance." 
   The ups and downs equal a median on which I travel daily. 
    I love those who understand me,  who chose to come close to the fire,
    who stay long enough to love its warmth,  and who know how to avoid being burned.
    I don’t trust people easily. I don’t throw around my heart. 
  
  <p>
  I grab hold of things, always seeking for GOD's help ,a rock on which to lean.
    I have tried girlfriends, boyfriends, and small successes in school and sports, 
    feeling the title FAILURE rise upon my forehead when I slipped. 
     Afterwards I tried even harder to bring myself back up, 
     my recovery taken on the quickest,  most unstable route.
       This explains how I fell so easily.  
       The self-esteem I had needed to be constantly replenished and refilled. 
        My source was not myself, but GOD, whose opinions mattered more than my own.
  
  </p>
  
  <p> I am passionate and at times fearless.
      I am everything, and I am nothing.  I am ever-changing and unpredictable. 
       I crave security but cry for independence.  
       I am black or white,  never gray.  My actions may not reflect my feelings and vice-versa. 
        I play the submissive female one minute and the aggressive female the next.

  </p>
  
  <p>Every year I learn more about myself.  The person inside no longer takes peeks at the world outside, 
     but screams "Look at me,  see what I’ve become,  watch because I am coming!" 
      I’ve been through difficult times and learn a lot through them. 
      I feel ready for any challenge that may arise.
